## Installation

You'll need Node.js installed to run this application. Once you've navigated to the project's directory from the command line, run "npm i" to install the required dependencies, which include express.js and Mongoose. Since this only a backend, you'll need a software like Insomnia to test the route functionality.

## Usage

After completing installation requirements and navigating into the project directory, run "node server.js" from the command line to start up the local server. You can then test the functiontality of the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes from a software like Insomnia, as demonstrated in the video link below.
